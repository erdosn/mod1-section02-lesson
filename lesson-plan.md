### Objectives
YWBAT
* write functions for a variety of objects
* create defaultdictionaries in functions
* calculate central tendancy statistics

Bonus
* Write lambda functions
* Apply functions within list comprehension
* use zip to create a dictionary


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from collections import defaultdict
from random import shuffle

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
present = ["alex", "nick", "gina", "jonathan", "bryan", "joel"]
shuffle(present)
present
```




    ['jonathan', 'nick', 'gina', 'bryan', 'joel', 'alex']




```python
lst = ["this", "is", "totally", "inspiring", "and", "amazing"]
```

### Writing Functions


```python
def find_word_length_sum(lst):
    """
    write a function that returns the sum of the lengths of all words in a list of strings
    """
    count = 0
    for word in lst:
        count += len(word)
    return count
```


```python
lst = ["this", "is", "a","list", "of", "strings"]
find_word_length_sum(lst) # 20
```




    20




```python
def group_even_odd(lst):
    """
    write a function that takes in a list of numbers
    returns a dictionary with the given structure
    keys = 'even' and 'odd'
    values = list -> list of numbers all being even or odd
    """
    d = {}
    d["evens"] = []
    d["odds"] = []
    for number in lst:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            d["evens"].append(number)
        else:
            d["odds"].append(number)
    return d
```


```python
lst = [2, 12, 10, 11, 13, 53, 14, 15]
group_even_odd(lst) # {'even': [2, 10, 12, 14], 'odd': [11, 13, 53, 15]}
```




    {'evens': [2, 12, 10, 14], 'odds': [11, 13, 53, 15]}




```python
def group_words_by_length(lst):
    """
    def group_even_odd(lst):
    write a function that takes in a list of words and
    returns a dictionary with the given structure
    keys = integers -> length of words
    values = list -> list of words with the given length
    
    hint: use defaultdict
    """
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for word in lst:
        key = len(word)
        d[key].append(word)
    return d
```


```python
lst = ["this", "is", "a","list", "of", "strings", "list"]
group_words_by_length(lst) # {4: ["this", "list"], 2:["is", "of"], 1: ["a"], 7:["strings"]}
```




    defaultdict(list,
                {1: ['a'],
                 2: ['is', 'of'],
                 4: ['this', 'list', 'list'],
                 7: ['strings']})




```python
def median_mean_greater(numbers):
    """
    write a function that returns if the median or mean of a list of numbers is greater.
    
    return "median" or "mean" depending on which is greater
    """
    pass
```


```python
numbers = np.random.randint(0, 100, 20)
median_mean_greater(numbers) # varies based on numbers
```


```python
### Plot the histogram of the numbers from above
### make sure to add a vertical line for the mean and a vertical line for the median

#code goes here
```


```python
numbers_2 = np.random.randint(0, 100, 20)
```


```python
### Plot both distributions (numbers_1, numbers_2) on the same histogram
### Add a legend to the plot and add a vertical line for the each mean

### code goes here
```


```python
### create a random list of  50 numbers using np.random.randint
### numbers must be between 20 and 100
### graph the boxplot of your numbers and analyze your findings

### code goes here
```

### Extra Fun Stuff


```python
tweet = "Buying a car in 2019 that canâ€™t upgrade to full self-driving is like buying a horse instead of a car in 1919"
```


```python
tweet_words = tweet.split(" ")
```


```python
### write a lambda function that takes in a string and returns the length of the string
```


```python
### create a list of the length of each word in tweet
### bonus if you use 'def' method, bonus bonus if you use lambda

```
